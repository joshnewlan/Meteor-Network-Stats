# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  
#   - uses: actions/checkout@v2
#     with:
#       # The branch, tag or SHA to checkout. When checking out the repository that
#       # triggered a workflow, this defaults to the reference or SHA for that event.
#       # Otherwise, uses the default branch.
#       ref: 'nightly'
  
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
